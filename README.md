# UUU UI theme

This is a UI for UUU.

UUU can easily change the colors of this ui so, make it  UUUr way.

## Gotchas

- Avoid making the text color the same colors as the ones that GIT uses to indicate new, modified and deleted lines/files. However, you can change text colors and GIT colors in UUU UI. Yet nothing indicates a new file better than green does.
